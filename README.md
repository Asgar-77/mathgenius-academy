## üîß Key Assumptions Made

### Technical Assumptions
- **Internet Connection**: Required for AI question generation via Groq API
- **Modern Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge for optimal experience
- **JavaScript Enabled**: For interactive features and animations
- **Screen Resolution**: Optimized for desktop (900x600+) but mobile-responsive

### Educational Assumptions
- **Grade-Level Mapping**: Questions are mapped to typical curriculum standards
- **English Language**: All content is in English (future multilingual support planned)
- **Basic Math Knowledge**: Students should have foundational knowledge for their selected grade
- **Self-Assessment**: Students can honestly select their appropriate grade level

### User Experience Assumptions
- **Session-Based**: Progress is stored in browser session (no persistent accounts)
- **Single User**: Designed for individual learning sessions
- **Immediate Feedback**: Students benefit from instant question feedback
- **Hint System**: Students will use hints constructively for learning

## üí° Design Choices Explained

### Architecture Decisions

#### **1. Streamlit Framework**
- **Why**: Rapid development, built-in UI components, easy deployment
- **Trade-off**: Less customization vs faster development
- **Benefit**: Focus on educational content rather than web development

#### **2. Groq API (Llama 3.3 70B)**
- **Why**: Fast inference, high-quality question generation, cost-effective
- **Alternative Considered**: OpenAI GPT-4 (more expensive, slower)
- **Benefit**: Real-time question generation with excellent mathematical reasoning

#### **3. Session State Management**
- **Why**: Simple, no database required, immediate functionality
- **Trade-off**: No persistence vs simplicity
- **Future**: Will add database for user accounts and progress tracking

### UI/UX Design Choices

#### **4. Branding Removal**
- **Why**: Professional appearance, focus on content, white-label experience
- **Implementation**: Custom CSS + Streamlit config to hide all branding
- **Benefit**: Clean interface that looks like a dedicated educational platform

#### **5. Light Mode Only**
- **Why**: Better readability for mathematical content, consistent experience
- **Implementation**: Forced light theme via config and CSS overrides
- **Benefit**: Optimal contrast for equations and diagrams

#### **6. Card-Based Layout**
- **Why**: Modern design, clear content separation, mobile-friendly
- **Implementation**: Custom CSS with gradients and shadows
- **Benefit**: Engaging visual hierarchy that guides attention

### Educational Design Choices

#### **7. Hint System**
- **Why**: Scaffolded learning, reduces frustration, promotes understanding
- **Implementation**: AI-generated hints for each question
- **Benefit**: Students learn problem-solving strategies, not just answers

#### **8. Multiple Difficulty Modes**
- **Why**: Accommodates different learning styles and confidence levels
- **Implementation**: Easy/Medium/Hard with different AI prompts
- **Benefit**: Personalized challenge level for optimal learning zone

#### **9. Progress Visualization**
- **Why**: Motivates continued learning, shows improvement patterns
- **Implementation**: Plotly charts with performance trends
- **Benefit**: Data-driven insights into learning progress
